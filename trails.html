  <h1>Trails</h1>

  <p>A trail is a path through terrain that someone else already walked. They cleared the way, marked the turnings, and left enough trace that you don't have to start from scratch. You still do the walking yourself. The effort is yours. But the route is shared.</p>

  <p>This page is a collection of trails in that sense — lines of thinking, reading, and attention worth following. Not a reading list. Not a set of recommendations. Just routes that turned out to go somewhere worth going.</p>

  <h2>On keeping records</h2>

  <p>The problem with trails is that they disappear if no one walks them. A footpath through a field, unused for one season, closes over. The same is true of intellectual paths. The essay no one shares, the argument no one carries forward, the connection no one makes again — these fade back into undifferentiated terrain as though they were never there.</p>

  <p>Writing things down is a form of trail maintenance. Not so that others will follow exactly, but so that the path remains visible. What someone else does with a visible path is their own business.</p>

  <blockquote>The map is not the territory. But without the map, you cover the same ground twice.</blockquote>

  <h2>What belongs here</h2>

  <p>Trails is for the slower kind of reading. For things that take more than one sitting, or that you come back to after weeks away and find changed — not because the text changed, but because you did. Books, long essays, sequences of thought that develop across multiple pieces of work.</p>

  <p>It is also for the things that resist categorisation: the article that doesn't quite fit any folder you have, the idea that keeps appearing in unrelated places, the book you'd recommend to someone but only if they'd already read three other things first.</p>

  <h2>On getting lost</h2>

  <p>The best trails include at least one place where you lose the path. Where the markers stop and you have to look at the landscape directly and make a decision. This is not a flaw in the trail. It is the point of it — the moment where following becomes thinking.</p>

  <p>A trail that never loses you has already made all your decisions. It is useful, but it is not interesting. The ones worth walking always have a section where the ground is less certain, where you have to pay attention, where you might be wrong.</p>

  <blockquote>Getting lost is not failure. It is the moment the trail becomes yours.</blockquote>
