    <h1>On Reading Slowly</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>There is a difference between processing text and reading it. Processing is fast — you scan for the key points, extract the argument, move on. Reading is something else. It lets the sentences settle.</p>
<p>I've started timing myself with books. Not to go faster. To go slower. A page every ten minutes. A chapter an hour. The kind of pace that lets you stop and stare out the window without losing your place, because the place you're in is your mind, not the book.</p>
<blockquote>A sentence you had to slow down for stays with you differently than one you slid through.</blockquote>
<h2>What Gets Lost at Speed</h2>
<p>Most of what's worth noticing in a piece of writing lives in the details: a word choice, a rhythm, an unexpected pivot. These don't register at scan speed. They require something closer to attention than consumption.</p>
<p>Speed-reading optimizes for coverage. But coverage of what? A book half-understood is a book half-read.</p></div>
