    <h1>Against Optimization</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>There is a certain kind of person who, confronted with any process, immediately asks how it could be done faster. I used to be that person. I optimized my morning, my reading, my routes to work. I got very good at doing things quickly and lost any sense of why I was doing them.</p>
<p>Optimization is seductive because it feels like progress. You're improving. You're getting better. But better at what, exactly?</p>
<blockquote>Efficiency is a good servant and a terrible master.</blockquote>
<h2>The Cost of Frictionlessness</h2>
<p>Friction slows you down. It also makes you pay attention. The long way round a city teaches you the city. The slow read of a difficult book teaches you to think. Remove the friction and you remove the learning that lives inside it.</p>
<p>Some of the best conversations I've had started because something went wrong and we had to wait. Some of the best ideas arrived in the space that inefficiency created.</p>
<h2>What to Optimize For</h2>
<p>I still optimize — I just try to be more deliberate about what I'm optimizing for. Not speed. Not throughput. Sometimes the metric worth maximizing is depth, or presence, or the chance of being surprised.</p></div>
