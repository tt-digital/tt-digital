excerpt: A digital clock tells me the time. An analog one shows me where I stand inside it.

The analog clock makes time spatial. 2:30 PM — the hands form an angle, a gesture. You see not just the hour, but how far to midnight, how long since noon.

Time as area, not as number. That changes your relationship to it.

Maybe that's also why handwritten notes stick better than typed ones. The movement encodes the information.
