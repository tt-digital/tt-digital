    <h1>The Value of Constraints</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>Every constraint is a decision already made. The sonnet's fourteen lines, the haiku's seventeen syllables, the one-hour time limit. The form doesn't restrict the work — it makes it possible by eliminating infinite choice.</p>
<p>Without constraints, you're not free. You're paralyzed.</p>
<blockquote>The blank page is terrifying precisely because it permits everything.</blockquote>
<h2>The Freedom Inside Limits</h2>
<p>A composer once told me he loved writing for specific instruments because each one said no to certain things. The no made the yes meaningful. You couldn't write impossibly high for a cello, so you wrote what was actually possible — and often beautiful.</p>
<p>I think about this when I'm stuck. The solution isn't more options. It's fewer. Pick a constraint, arbitrary if necessary, and work within it.</p></div>
