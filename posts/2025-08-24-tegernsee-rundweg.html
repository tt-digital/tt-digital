    <h1>Tegernsee Rundweg</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>The path out of town follows the eastern shore before climbing into the hills. By ten in the morning the trail is quiet — a few older couples with walking poles, a dog pulling its owner uphill. Everyone else is still on the terrace below.</p>
<p>There is something particular about hiking in summer heat: the shade of the forest matters in a way it doesn't at other times. You move from brightness to cool and back, and each transition feels earned.</p>
<blockquote>A lake is not the same seen from the water and seen from above. Both are correct, but only one requires the climb.</blockquote>
<h2>On the descent</h2>
<p>Coming down in the early afternoon, the town looked small and exact against the water. The kind of view that makes ordinary things seem well-arranged. I sat with it for a moment before walking back in.</p>
<p>The whole loop was about four hours. No dramatic exposure, no scrambling — just a clean circuit through beech forest and open meadow with the lake appearing and disappearing below. Exactly what a Sunday in August should be.</p></div>
