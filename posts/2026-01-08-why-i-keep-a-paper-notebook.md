title: Why I Keep a Paper Notebook

excerpt: The notebook doesn't sync, crash, or require a password. That's most of the appeal.

I've tried every notes app. Some are genuinely good. None of them feel like thinking.

Paper is different. You can't copy-paste. You can't reformat. You have to write it once, in the order you thought it, with whatever pen is nearby. The constraint forces a kind of clarity that doesn't happen when editing is frictionless.

> A thought written by hand is a thought you committed to, however briefly.

## The Slowness Is the Feature

Typing is faster than thinking. Writing by hand is slower. That gap — where your hand can't quite keep up with your mind — is where the editing happens before the words arrive. You choose more carefully. You abbreviate. You draw arrows between things.

The notebook also doesn't ask anything of you. No notifications. No battery. No temptation to check something else. It is entirely, aggressively present.

## What Stays

I've found that things written in notebooks stay in memory differently than things typed. Whether it's the physical gesture, the smell of the ink, or just the slower pace — something about the analog act makes it stick.
