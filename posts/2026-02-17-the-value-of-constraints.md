excerpt: Limits feel like obstacles until you realize they're the thing making the work possible.

Every constraint is a decision already made. The sonnet's fourteen lines, the haiku's seventeen syllables, the one-hour time limit. The form doesn't restrict the work — it makes it possible by eliminating infinite choice.

Without constraints, you're not free. You're paralyzed.

## The Freedom Inside Limits

A composer once told me he loved writing for specific instruments because each one said no to certain things. The no made the yes meaningful. You couldn't write impossibly high for a cello, so you wrote what was actually possible — and often beautiful.

I think about this when I'm stuck. The solution isn't more options. It's fewer. Pick a constraint, arbitrary if necessary, and work within it.
