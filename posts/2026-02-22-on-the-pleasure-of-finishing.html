    <h1>On the Pleasure of Finishing</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>We talk a lot about beginnings. First drafts, new projects, fresh starts. The mythology of the blank page. What we talk about less is the specific satisfaction of finishing something — really finishing it, not abandoning it at ninety percent.</p>
<p>Finishing requires a different kind of discipline than starting. Starting runs on excitement. Finishing runs on commitment to something that no longer feels new.</p>
<blockquote>Done is not a compromise. Done is the whole point.</blockquote>
<h2>The Ninety Percent Problem</h2>
<p>Most things die in the last stretch. The book that's almost written. The project that just needs one more pass. The letter that's been sitting in drafts for three weeks.</p>
<p>I've started treating the final ten percent as a separate task with its own energy budget. Not a continuation of the work — a completion of it. The difference in framing matters more than it should.</p></div>
