    <h1>On Forgetting</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>We treat forgetting as failure. A thing happened, and now it's gone, and that's a loss. We take photos to prevent it, write notes to catch it, build systems to hold it all. As if the point were to keep everything.</p>
<p>But the brain forgets for reasons. The trivial fades. The emotional stays. The things you return to get reinforced; the things you never revisit dissolve. This is not malfunction — it's curation.</p>
<blockquote>You don't remember your life. You remember a version of it, rebuilt each time from whatever remains.</blockquote>
<h2>What Forgetting Leaves Room For</h2>
<p>A friend once told me she stopped journaling because re-reading old entries made her feel stuck in versions of herself she'd already left behind. The forgetting, she said, was what allowed her to change.</p>
<p>There's something in that. Memory preserves identity. Forgetting makes space for it to evolve.</p>
<h2>The Things That Stay</h2>
<p>What I find interesting is not what I forget but what persists without effort — the images, phrases, and moments that simply refuse to go. I've stopped trying to understand why those particular things and not others. Whatever the mechanism, it seems to know something I don't.</p></div>
