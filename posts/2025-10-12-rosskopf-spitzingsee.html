    <h1>Rosskopf via Spitzingsee</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>October in the Bavarian Alps means something specific: the tourists are mostly gone, the days have that clean northern light, and there is frost on the higher trails before noon if you started early enough. Which we had.</p>
<p>The route from Spitzingsee gains five hundred metres before the ridge, then follows it east in full exposure. The kind of walk where the wind decides the mood.</p>
<blockquote>At altitude in October you are not in summer anymore. You are in something else — closer to winter, closer to what the mountains are most of the year.</blockquote>
<h2>What changes above the treeline</h2>
<p>Above 1400 metres the scale shifts. Below that point you are moving through landscape; above it, the landscape is moving around you. Clouds on a ridge don't look decorative. They look structural.</p>
<p>The descent back via the western shoulder took nearly as long as the ascent. The knees remember what the lungs already knew. We were back at the car by early afternoon with that particular tiredness that comes from having been somewhere real.</p></div>
