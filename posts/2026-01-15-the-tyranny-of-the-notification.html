    <h1>The Tyranny of the Notification</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>A notification is a request disguised as information. It arrives uninvited, borrows your focus for a moment, and leaves without paying it back. Multiply by fifty. Multiply by a day.</p>
<p>The damage isn't the individual interruption. It's the cumulative cost of never being fully anywhere. You're always half-present, one eye on the screen, waiting for the next small event to announce itself.</p>
<blockquote>Attention is not renewable. Whatever you spend it on is what you were alive for.</blockquote>
<h2>What We Traded</h2>
<p>We traded boredom for stimulation and called it progress. But boredom was doing something. It was the gap where thoughts connected, where the mind wandered productively, where you noticed the world around you.</p>
<p>The notification filled the gap. Now the gap is gone, and with it a certain quality of experience that's hard to name but easy to miss once you've had it.</p>
<h2>Turning Things Off</h2>
<p>I've been experimenting with notification-free mornings. No alerts until noon. The first hour is now the best hour — not because anything changed, but because nothing interrupted it.</p></div>
