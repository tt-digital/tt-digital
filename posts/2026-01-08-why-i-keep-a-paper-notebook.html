    <h1>Why I Keep a Paper Notebook</h1>
    <div class="post-body"><p>I've tried every notes app. Some are genuinely good. None of them feel like thinking.</p>
<p>Paper is different. You can't copy-paste. You can't reformat. You have to write it once, in the order you thought it, with whatever pen is nearby. The constraint forces a kind of clarity that doesn't happen when editing is frictionless.</p>
<blockquote>A thought written by hand is a thought you committed to, however briefly.</blockquote>
<h2>The Slowness Is the Feature</h2>
<p>Typing is faster than thinking. Writing by hand is slower. That gap — where your hand can't quite keep up with your mind — is where the editing happens before the words arrive. You choose more carefully. You abbreviate. You draw arrows between things.</p>
<p>The notebook also doesn't ask anything of you. No notifications. No battery. No temptation to check something else. It is entirely, aggressively present.</p>
<h2>What Stays</h2>
<p>I've found that things written in notebooks stay in memory differently than things typed. Whether it's the physical gesture, the smell of the ink, or just the slower pace — something about the analog act makes it stick.</p></div>
